# QuincuLandsWar
Re-implementing the lands war with kill points and capture flags

Requirements in wars.yml:
- Kill points must be set to zero. (They are handled separately by this plugin)
- BEACON and IRON_BLOCK must be in the break block list.

Hold time and placement cooldown will be synced to the values in the wars.yml 
- Set the times to their values in seconds for best results. eg. "150s"
